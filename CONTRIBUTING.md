# Contributing

## Commits

Follow conventional commits: `type: short description` (e.g. `fix: handle missing tag on thread create`).

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`.

## Branches

Rebase your branch onto `main` before opening a PR to keep the history linear and avoid merge commits.

```
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```
